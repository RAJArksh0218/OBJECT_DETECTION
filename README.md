🧠 YOLO Object Detection System:
A real-time object detection application using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm. This AI-powered system can detect and classify multiple objects in images or video feeds using deep learning.

📸 How It Works
Accepts input from images, videos, or webcam.

YOLO divides the input into grids and makes predictions in one pass.

Each grid cell detects objects and their bounding boxes with class probabilities.

Displays results with bounding boxes and class labels in real-time.

🔍 Key Features
Real-time object detection using YOLO

Supports detection of multiple objects in a single frame

Fast inference with high accuracy

Visual output with bounding boxes and confidence scores

Can process images, webcam feeds, or video files

🧠 Tech Stack
Python

OpenCV

YOLOv5 or YOLOv8 (via Ultralytics or custom weights)

Deep learning frameworks: PyTorch or TensorFlow

⚙️ Setup Instructions:
Clone the repository

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Download YOLO model weights (yolov5s.pt, yolov8n.pt, etc.)

Run detection:

python detect.py --source 0  # for webcam
💡 Use Cases
Self-driving cars (detect pedestrians, vehicles, traffic signs)

CCTV surveillance

Industrial automation & robotics

Wildlife monitoring and drone-based observation

🔐 Security Note
If using a hosted service or API-based model:

Never expose private API keys in frontend code.

Use backend proxy or environment variables to secure credentials.

📈 Future Improvements
Web interface using Flask/Streamlit for easy testing

Custom dataset training with YOLOv8

Model performance comparison (YOLO vs SSD vs Faster R-CNN)

Integration with cloud (e.g., GCP/AWS) for large-scale inference
